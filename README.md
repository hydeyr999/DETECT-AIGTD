# DETECT

## Introduction

The `DETECT` dataset contains several different AI-generated text datasets. Each file in this dataset corresponds to text generated by different large language models (LLMs) and various operations. 

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of the following seven files, each containing text generated by different LLMs:

- **xsum-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on news articles.
- **writingprompts-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on creative writings.
- **pubmedqa-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on academic abstracts.
- **squad-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on wiki texts.
- **openreview-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on peer reviews.
- **blog-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on blogs.
- **tweets-00000-of-00001.parquet**: Contains text generated based on tweets.

Each file contains the following fields:

- **text**: text.
- **generated**: 0: human text; 1: AI-generated text.
- **model**: The language model used for generating the text.
- **operation**: The operation type performed on the data.
- **id**: A unique identifier for each record.
- **text_len10**: The first 10 characters of the text.
- **text_len50**: The first 50 characters of the text.
- **text_len100**: The first 100 characters of the text.
- **text_len200**: The first 200 characters of the text.
- **text_len500**: The 500 characters of the text.

### Example Data

An example record might look like this:

| id  | text                      | generated                | model   | operation | text_len10 | text_len50 | text_len100 | text_len200 | text_len500 |
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | "What is artificial intelligence?..." | 1 | gpt-4o  | polish        |   "What is artificial intelligence?..."        |  "What is artificial intelligence?..."         |  "What is artificial intelligence?..."         |  "What is artificial intelligence?..."         |  "What is artificial intelligence?..."         |

## Dataset Format

The dataset is stored in Parquet format. Each file contains a dataset with multiple records, and each record includes one or more of the fields mentioned above. You can load and manipulate this data using any tool that supports Parquet format, such as Apache Arrow, Pandas, or PyArrow.

### Loading Data Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to load a Parquet file using Python and Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the Parquet file
data = pd.read_parquet("path/to/your/xsum-00000-of-00001.parquet")

# View the first five rows of the data
print(data.head())
```
